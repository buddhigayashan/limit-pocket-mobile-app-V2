🛠️ Technical Implementation
The mobile application was built using Kotlin for Android. Initially, I implemented local data storage using SharedPreferences for simplicity. As the app matured, I migrated to SQLite for structured data storage and later integrated Room ORM for efficient database access and better data abstraction.

The app also features a React.js web interface connected to a shared Node.js backend, enabling cross-platform data synchronization for an enhanced user experience.
